## Getting Started

### Requirements



### Installation

Following are the two ways you can use our application.
1. Install using `.apk` file in `dist/` folder. You would need to enable _Install from Unknown Sources_ in the Security Settings on your Android.
2. Import the entire project in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). Install all requirements and project dependencies, and run `app` module on an emulator or on your Android.
**Note:** Please disable Instant Run feature on Android Studio before running the app. [`SugarORM`](https://github.com/satyan/sugar) has a [history](https://github.com/satyan/sugar/issues/75) of not creating tables when Instant Run is on.
